#' Package marshal - Marshal Objects to be Used in Another R Processes
#'
#' Some types of R objects can be used only in the R session they were created.  If used as-is in another R process, such objects often result in an immediate error or in obscure and hard-to-troubleshoot outcomes.  Because of this, they cannot be saved to file and re-used at a later time.  They can also not be exported to a worker in parallel processing.  These objects are sometimes referred to as non-exportable or non-serializable objects.  One solution to this problem is to use "marshalling" to encode the R object into an exportable representation that then can be used to re-create a copy of that object in another R process.  This package provides a framework for marshalling and unmarshalling R objects such that they can be transferred using functions such as `serialize()` and `unserialize()` of base R.
